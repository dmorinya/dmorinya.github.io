Special issue on Mathematics journal
------
I'm currently preparing a special issue entitled *Misreported data modeling* for [Mathematics journal](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/mathematics) with Prof. Amanda Fernández-Fontelo (Humboldt Universität-zu Berlin). This volume deals with the problem of modeling misreported data. The most common phenomenon in this context is facing underreported or partially registered information, as the current worldwide Covid-19 pandemic has shown; but it is also possible to deal with overreported data in some contexts. The sources and underlying mechanisms that cause the misreporting differ depending on the field and particular data. This issue affects data quality and is likely to lead to biased results and conclusions, as the reported information reflect only a fraction of the actual phenomenon under study. There are several attempts to address this issue from different approaches in the recent literature, but many questions remain still open. More information available [here] (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/mathematics/special_issues/advances_misreported_data_modeling).

Keywords: Mathematical modeling; misreported data; longitudinal data; under-registered data; over-reported data.
