Introduction
================
Gender-based violence is the violence suffered by women for the sole reason of being so and is the
most serious manifestation of patriarchal culture, taking womenâ€™s lives or impeding the full
development of their rights, equal opportunities, and freedoms. In Spain, in the period 2010-2021, 653
women have lost their lives due to gender-based violence, and 7 in 2022 (until March 14th). According
to the Statistical Dossier of Gender-Based Violence 2020 published by the Catalan Women's Institute1,
more than 16,000 complaints were lodged in Catalonia in 2019, 82% of which occurred in the scope of
a sentimental partnership. Figure 1 depicts the number of gender-based violence reported cases in the
different geographic areas of a particular health region in Catalonia, and it can be seen that the Covid-
19 pandemic has increased the number of reported cases dramatically, especially due to a differential
behavior during the pandemic (mobility restrictions, mandatory confinements1), and a training
intervention conducted over health professionals in this area starting in mid 2018. Despite the large
number of complaints, it is suspected that they represent only a small portion of the cases occurring,
as for very different reasons, the victims often decide not to report the assaults they suffer.
