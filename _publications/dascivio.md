Introduction
------
Gender-based violence is the violence suffered by women for the sole reason of being so and is the
most serious manifestation of patriarchal culture, taking women's lives or impeding the full
development of their rights, equal opportunities, and freedoms. In Spain, in the period 2010-2021, 653
women have lost their lives due to gender-based violence, and 7 in 2022 (until March 14th). According
to the Statistical Dossier of Gender-Based Violence 2020 published by the Catalan Women's Institute,
more than 16,000 complaints were lodged in Catalonia in 2019, 82% of which occurred in the scope of
a sentimental partnership. Figure 1 depicts the number of gender-based violence reported cases in the
different geographic areas of a particular health region in Catalonia, and it can be seen that the Covid-
19 pandemic has increased the number of reported cases dramatically, especially due to a differential
behavior during the pandemic (mobility restrictions, mandatory confinements), and a training
intervention conducted over health professionals in this area starting in mid 2018. Despite the large
number of complaints, it is suspected that they represent only a small portion of the cases occurring,
as for very different reasons, the victims often decide not to report the assaults they suffer.

Region in Catalonia (Spain).*

As reported in the document on tackling sexual violence in Catalonia, being a victim of sexual violence
is often fraught with guilt that can lead to denial of sexual violence. Therefore, it is reasonable to think
that the number of diagnoses related to gender-based violence recorded in the public health system
databases may be underestimating the magnitude of the problem. It is clear that once an estimate of
the real extent of the problem has been obtained, it would be very useful not to leave the decision to alert about a possible case of gender-based violence (especially for suspicious unconfirmed cases) to
health professionals but providing them with a tool that can do it automatically, based on artificial
intelligence methods and capable of identifying the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics that
modify the likelihood that a woman might be a victim of gender-based violence.
In 2019, the Ministry of Equity of the Spanish Government conducted a large survey on over 9,500
women over 16 years old focused on studying the prevalence of gender-based violence in Spain and
detecting potentially vulnerable subpopulations. As can be seen in Figure 2, the proportion of women
reporting to have suffered physical or sexual violence is not uniform across the Spanish provinces,
ranging from 7% to 45%. Also shocking is the result that, among these women, only a small fraction of
them have searched for health services (excluding hospitalization), and that there is a negative
correlation between the proportion of gender-based violence victims and usage of health services
(correlation of -0.26, 90% CI: -0.47 to -0.04), probably related to factors like rurality, ease of access to
health services and different age structures among provinces, which will also be accounted for in the
framework of this project.

Aims and hypotheses
------
This project's overarching objective is to improve the social and health care model for the victim and
her environment in cases of gender-based violence, using advanced data science and mathematical
modeling methods. We have set four specific objectives, which are further described below:

O1. Estimate the actual evolution of the number of gender-based violence cases, also covering the
unreported cases, using the time series of registered cases by basic health area corresponding to the
Northern Metropolitan Health Region.

O2. Quantify the impact in reducing the underreporting issue of the new protocol to prevent gender-
based violence introduced in the primary care system in the Northern Metropolitan Health Region in
Catalonia in June 2018 and the training intervention conducted to sensibilize involved health
professionals.

O3. Predict when women may be victims of gender-based violence early on by developing new
ensemble models based on a broad collection of clinical and sociodemographic features and identify
which of these features are best predictors of such violence to create new knowledge in the field.

O4. Develop technology capable of predicting women's characteristics compatible with a scenario of
gender-based violence to assist health and social care professionals in identifying potential scenarios
of this sort of violence in a clear and transparent manner.
