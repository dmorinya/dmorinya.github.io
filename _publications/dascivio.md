Introduction
------
Gender-based violence is the violence suffered by women for the sole reason of being so and is the
most serious manifestation of patriarchal culture, taking women's lives or impeding the full
development of their rights, equal opportunities, and freedoms. In Spain, in the period 2010-2021, 653
women have lost their lives due to gender-based violence, and 7 in 2022 (until March 14th). According
to the Statistical Dossier of Gender-Based Violence 2020 published by the Catalan Women's Institute,
more than 16,000 complaints were lodged in Catalonia in 2019, 82% of which occurred in the scope of
a sentimental partnership. Figure 1 depicts the number of gender-based violence reported cases in the
different geographic areas of a particular health region in Catalonia, and it can be seen that the Covid-
19 pandemic has increased the number of reported cases dramatically, especially due to a differential
behavior during the pandemic (mobility restrictions, mandatory confinements), and a training
intervention conducted over health professionals in this area starting in mid 2018. Despite the large
number of complaints, it is suspected that they represent only a small portion of the cases occurring,
as for very different reasons, the victims often decide not to report the assaults they suffer.

Region in Catalonia (Spain).*

As reported in the document on tackling sexual violence in Catalonia, being a victim of sexual violence
is often fraught with guilt that can lead to denial of sexual violence. Therefore, it is reasonable to think
that the number of diagnoses related to gender-based violence recorded in the public health system
databases may be underestimating the magnitude of the problem. It is clear that once an estimate of
the real extent of the problem has been obtained, it would be very useful not to leave the decision to alert about a possible case of gender-based violence (especially for suspicious unconfirmed cases) to
health professionals but providing them with a tool that can do it automatically, based on artificial
intelligence methods and capable of identifying the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics that
modify the likelihood that a woman might be a victim of gender-based violence.
In 2019, the Ministry of Equity of the Spanish Government conducted a large survey on over 9,500
women over 16 years old focused on studying the prevalence of gender-based violence in Spain and
detecting potentially vulnerable subpopulations. As can be seen in Figure 2, the proportion of women
reporting to have suffered physical or sexual violence is not uniform across the Spanish provinces,
ranging from 7% to 45%. Also shocking is the result that, among these women, only a small fraction of
them have searched for health services (excluding hospitalization), and that there is a negative
correlation between the proportion of gender-based violence victims and usage of health services
(correlation of -0.26, 90% CI: -0.47 to -0.04), probably related to factors like rurality, ease of access to
health services and different age structures among provinces, which will also be accounted for in the
framework of this project.

Aims and hypotheses
------
This project's overarching objective is to improve the social and health care model for the victim and
her environment in cases of gender-based violence, using advanced data science and mathematical
modeling methods. We have set four specific objectives, which are further described below:

O1. Estimate the actual evolution of the number of gender-based violence cases, also covering the
unreported cases, using the time series of registered cases by basic health area corresponding to the
Northern Metropolitan Health Region.

O2. Quantify the impact in reducing the underreporting issue of the new protocol to prevent gender-
based violence introduced in the primary care system in the Northern Metropolitan Health Region in
Catalonia in June 2018 and the training intervention conducted to sensibilize involved health
professionals.

O3. Predict when women may be victims of gender-based violence early on by developing new
ensemble models based on a broad collection of clinical and sociodemographic features and identify
which of these features are best predictors of such violence to create new knowledge in the field.

O4. Develop technology capable of predicting women's characteristics compatible with a scenario of
gender-based violence to assist health and social care professionals in identifying potential scenarios
of this sort of violence in a clear and transparent manner.

Innovation
------
The current project is novel at least in two ways: First, it uses real-world data that have not been
analyzed in much detail before to estimate underreporting, predict potential victims of gender-based
violence as well as generate accurate knowledge in the field to allow professionals updating their
protocols and perspectives on certain aspects of the problem. Second, we will develop more flexible
and appropriate methods for underreporting estimation and predictive purposes (see specific
objectives described above), with the aim of improving the existing counterparts’ performances, thus
providing more accurate outcomes and outputs from this project.
In terms of data, for underreporting estimation (specific objectives O1. and O2., see above), we will
use all the primary care diagnoses related to gender-based violence reported in the Northern
Metropolitan Health Region in Catalonia (Spain) between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021. To
date, underreporting in such data has not been studied or accurately estimated, even though
professionals in the field are aware that this is a common phenomenon of gender-based violence data
which worsen inferences and related conclusions. In addition, for the predictive purposes outlined in
the third and fourth specific objectives (see specific objectives O3. and O4. above), we will use data
from the macro-survey on violence against women, which was performed on a representative sample
of 9.568 women aged over 16. The survey covered aspects related to sexual, psychological, and
economic violence from a current or former partners, physical and sexual violence from non-partners,
sexual harassment, and stalking (all these manifestations of violence englobed in the concept of
gender-based violence), as well as other demographical and societal data such as age, education level,
country of birth, marital status at the time of the survey, employment detail at the time of the survey,
number of sons, partner’s gender, partner’s education level and partner's nationality, among others.
For knowledge generation in the field (stated in the specific objective O3.), we will use data from the
macro-survey described above, e.g., detecting the variables that best predicted risk of suffering
gender-based violence, as well as new data consisting of women's characteristics such as age and
nationality, and women’s health indicators such as the number of medical visits, number and status of
pregnancies, number of miscarriages, urgency contraception usage, tobacco and alcohol status,
physical activity, sexual relations, STI risk status, number of cytologies. These characteristics will be
available for a sample of women who have already been diagnosed as victims of gender-based violence, as well as for a sample of women from the same region who have used the public health
system at least once during the same time period although they were not diagnosed as victims of
gender-based violence. We will use two different sets of data to create knowledge in the form of
features or attributes that best characterize victims of gender-based violence given that the macro-
survey does not contain information related to women's health status, and this may be also relevant
for the quick identification of potential victims, especially for the health professionals. To our
knowledge, none of these datasets have been used for predictive purposes or for field knowledge
production (in the terms stated in this project, i.e., for the detection of features as good predictors of
gender-based violence) so far, even though both contain a wealth of rich and accurate information.
In terms of methods development, for the purpose of underreporting estimation, we will extend
recently proposed models based on longitudinal data analysis to analyze whether the incidence of
the reported cases of gender-based violence has been underreported, as well as to estimate the
frequency and intensity of the underreporting issue (specific objectives O1. and O2.). This model will
be extended in different ways: Firstly, we will consider a time-varying underreporting scenario, i.e., we
will allow underreporting parameters (frequency and intensity) to vary over time by considering
appropriate and flexible functions. Second, we will investigate more complex structures for the latent
processes, e.g., allowing more complex auto-correlation structures that may be more realistic, as well
as more flexible models for characterizing the underreporting phenomenon. In addition, we will
explore new alternatives for developing models for underreporting identification and estimation
following methods based on N-mixture models, Bayesian approaches or capture-recapture
methods, among other approaches.
Finally, for achieving the third and fourth specific objectives (O3. and O4.), we will develop: (i) methods
for variable selection and dimensionality reduction and (ii) prediction methods based on ensemble
approaches. For the first point before, given that a large number of important potential predictors for
gender-based violence identification is available, we will investigate and develop new methods for
variable selection based on knockoffs. Knockoff-based methods are a general framework for
controlling the false discovery rate in variable selection procedures. The idea here is to investigate
some of these existing techniques to select a collection of variables that are actually effective
predictors of gender-based violence and extend some of the existing knockoff-based methods to
improve the current project's outcomes. Techniques for variable selection based on knockoffs are
relatively new since they have not been explored in detail to date, and while there is a lot of good
literature out there, there is still a lot of room for improvements in this area. For the second point, using the outcomes provided by the previous step (i), we will develop new prediction models based on
ensemble techniques, which very often provide better predictive performances controlling
overfitting, lessening the curse of dimensionality, mitigating class imbalances, etc. The idea behind
ensemble techniques is to optimally combine a varied collection of weak learners that each captures
specific aspects of the data, and a key point is thus the way we combine such weak learners. This
project will build on different ensemble approaches, including adaptive boosting (AdaBoost),
gradient boosting machines, stacked generalization techniques, and ensemble deep learning. We will
extend some of these ensemble methods to provide a powerful predictive machine able to predict
women at risk of suffering gender-based violence, guaranteeing both low false-positive and false-
negative rates. To date, these approaches have never been used before to prevent gender-based
violence in the terms proposed by this project.

All data handling and statistical analyses will be conducted by developing new programs based on R
language (version 4.1.0), and all codes and algorithms generated by this project will be available from
public repositories as [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) or [CRAN](https://www.cran.r-project.org/) for full transparency.

Further details related to methods development will be described below in Section *Methodology*.

Expected outcomes and outputs
------
A number of outcomes and outputs will be generated within the framework of this research project,
in terms of methods development and related technologies, as well as knowledge generation in the
field.
In the first place, in terms of methods development and related technologies for underreporting
estimation (specific objectives O1. and O2.), new approaches to the analysis of this phenomenon in
data will be developed and integrated in the form of an R package, freely available and auditable to
the entire data science community. These extended methods will particularly be used to estimate the
true burden of gender-based violence in Catalonia in the period 2010-2021 and will allow us to
estimate the magnitude of the unseen part of the problem, likely comparable to that of other
neighboring countries. All these results and resources will be included in a web-page repository,
available to the scientific community as well as the general public, allowing everyone to have a better
understanding of the real extent of the problem. Second, in terms of methods development and
related technologies for prediction methods construction (specific objectives O3. and O4.), we will
provide a prediction technology aimed at estimating the risk of a certain woman suffering gender-based violence based on her social and clinical characteristics, so that it will be used as a potentially
helpful and transparent guide for the professionals in the field. This technology will be adapted and
incorporated in the software used by public health system professionals for new diagnoses reporting
(e-CAP environment).
In addition to the technologies described above for underreporting estimation and prediction
purposes, we plan to publish our developed methods and related technologies in top-tier research
journals in statistics and probability. We plan particularly to produce two papers with a methodological
scope, one with the proposed model for underreporting estimation and another with the proposed
predictive learning model. We also plan to present our methods in national and international
conferences such as International Workshop on Statistical Modelling (IWSM), national and
international conferences of respectively the Spanish Biometric Society and the International
Biometric Society, among others.
Secondly, in terms of knowledge generation in the field, the estimation of underreporting of the
number of gender-based violence victims in the Northern Metropolitan Health Region of Catalonia
(Spain) between 2010 and 2021 will provide knowledge not only about the estimated frequency and
intensity of such a phenomenon in each basic health area, but also about the estimated underreporting
parameters' evolution over time, which can be used to determine if, e.g., the training interventions
undertaken with health professionals in a studied basic health area had a significant influence on the
evolution of gender-based violence underreporting. With robust estimates of the underreporting
parameters (i.e., frequency and intensity) given by our developed models and implemented in the
above-described technologies, we will be able to help the community understand the scope of the
phenomenon in recent years and its evolution until now. In addition, knowledge of the magnitude of
the phenomenon will assist professionals in developing more appropriate health policies and measures
to control and (ideally) reduce the impact of underreporting in gender-based violence-related data.
Finally, this information will also be helpful to adjust inferences and related conclusions based on data
on gender-based violence. On the other hand, the knowledge provided by the prediction learning
technology, e.g., identification of clinical and sociodemographic characteristics that are particularly
good indicators of gender-based violence victims, can be used to better understand the problem, as
well as formulate new practices for health professionals and train them more accurately based on
data-based results. In addition to the new knowledge that this research project will bring to the field,
we plan to produce two papers for top applied scientific journals. Although the described outcomes
and results that this data science and statistical modeling approach can produce in order to better understand the real burden of gender-based violence and identifying the characteristics of potential
victims overcoming possible human biases and prejudices, to the date this path has been little
explored, while this project aims to achieve not only local answers to socially relevant research
questions but also to provide methodological and technological tools that could be adapted and used
in different contexts.

Social relevance
------
According to the United Nations organization (UN), gender-based violence refers to harmful acts
directed at an individual based on their gender20. It is rooted in gender inequality, the abuse of power
and harmful norms. Gender-based violence is a serious violation of human rights and a life-threatening
health and protection issue. It is estimated that one in three women will experience sexual or physical
violence in their lifetime worldwide, especially in situations of potential vulnerability as forced
displacements, wars, or economic crisis. Despite theoretical and regulatory advances in the field of
recognition of women's rights, the formal elimination of references to women's honor and honesty,
and the replacement of these references by sexual freedom, many patriarchal structures in the legal
and social understanding of sexual violence remain in the text of our laws, especially in their
interpretation. The large population-level survey conducted in Spain in 20194 including 9,568
interviewed women with 16 years or more revealed that gender-based violence is still an important
public health issue, as it shows, among other relevant results, that more than 50% of Spanish women
older than 16 years have suffered gender-based violence at some point in their lives. Also concerning
is that the proportion of victims of gender-based violence is larger among younger women.
This study also reveals that only a small fraction of victims seeks professional help after suffering an
episode of gender-based violence. For instance, only the 6.5% of victims of sexual violence received
medical assistance after the aggression, making it very complicated for public health system
professionals to diagnose these cases and leading to severely underestimated records.
In addition, unlike other forms of sexist violence, sexual violence still involves a very strong social
stigma, and its understanding is often full of stereotypes and prejudices that severely affect victims.
These phenomena, of course, are not exclusive to Catalonia or Spain, as they are widely documented
around the world and are also the starting point for this diagnosis. Therefore, the results and
methodological advances obtained using these data will be directly applicable worldwide, even in very
different realities and will certainly make a difference in our understanding and fight against gender-
based violence in all its forms.
